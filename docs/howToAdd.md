# Finding Things:
Character sheets are found in the following folder: `docs/charList`
Chapters are found in: `blog/yearX`

NSFW Chapters are under `my-second-blog/yearX`


# Adding files

Once in the folder hit add files at the top right then `Create new file` after that you will have an open text space. That is where you create your character sheet or story. 

Once done hit `commit changes`. Don't forget to name the file at the top or it wont let you commit changes

(This step can be repeated as many times as you want)

After hitting `new pull request` you should see this window. ensure that the base repository (value on the left). Says `StoneMcYT/susFic base: main` and the left has your username there.

If it says `There isn’t anything to compare.` you may have to hit the drop down menu on the right and change to another `branch` just click on `patch-X` then it should say that there are changes to merge.
