# How Are Fics Grouped?

Fics are grouped by Year, then Chapter. To add a fic via the folder, you will need to navigate through the following path: blog ➔ year ➔ chapter.

# The Timeline

The timeline should adhere to the following guidelines:

- For writing your chapters, they should usually be one-shots within the same universe. Avoid skipping around. For example, don't have Pedrito born, then the parents have intercourse. Maintain continuity in the timeline and try to write in a sequence of events.

## Location/Setting of the ENTIRE Fic

The fic is set in an Equestria-styled Earth. This means that the geography, city names, and states are the same as in real life, but they are under one Equestrian government.

## Keeping Track Of Dates/Months

In this fic, all years consist of 12 months, with each month being 30 days long. This format is used to avoid complications with leap years and awkward month lengths.

Additionally, for those using 'a moon' as a measurement, it refers to 30 days (1 month).

## City State Naming:

- USA has been renamed to Equestria with DC being Canterlot.
- Canada has been renamed to the Crystal Kingdom.
- A forest in france renamed to Kirin Kingdom
## Population Density != Goverments
Population Density does not mean who governs which area it just states which population lives most in each area

- Australia/New Zealand and that area are Changeling Territory.
- The African continent is mainly populated by Zebras.
- Kirin's are mostly concentrated in forest areas, with the highest density in South America, but they are spread out.
-- Kirins are spread out to create micro colonies in major forests

## Hierarchy

All countries and city-states, besides Changeling lands, have their figure monarchs as Celestia/Luna. Each has its own government and leadership, with the monarchs serving in advisory roles and handling any external threats, such as extreme magical occurrences like Snek appearing out of nowhere.

## Goverments/Lands/Sucession.

Each country will have a goverment or monarcy regardless of the real world states of its country. An example would be Grece being a pariment in real life whilst in the fic Derpy is the princess of Greece.

There are 2 types of royalty. One being country heads whilst one is the head head (someone get a better name for this). 
Country heads are non alicorns but are considered royalty. Whilst, the head head are Alicorns only or blood decendents of alicorns.

The current line of sucession for the head head is Luna/Celestia --> Twilight --> Pedrito.


## Money:

Currency is simlar to USD instead of currencies such as the Korean Won and vietnam dong. 

For scale (Approx):

An ice cream cone is $5
Rent is bout $300 a month for apartments (1 roomm, 1 main room mone kitch with running water)
Larger houses are in the millions

Net Worth (As of adding):
Royal Family $500 Bil
Dynascord %350 bil
Snek $250 Bil


## Technology:

The technology is a merge of S5 and modern day world.
Some things from our world carry over such as phones and computers but not missiles and guns for some reason. 
Furthermore, planes and rockets dont exist and contiental travel is dona via boats instead
