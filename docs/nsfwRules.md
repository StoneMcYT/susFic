# What defines a NSFW fic?
This list of NSFW is not limited to this (this list will be updated as time goes by and the defenition will change)

1. **Sexual Content**: NSFW fics often include explicit descriptions of sexual acts, intimacy, or sexual tension between characters.

2. **Nudity**: Depictions of characters in a state of undress or nudity can be a common element in NSFW fics.

3. **Strong Language**: The use of profanity, explicit language, or offensive words is prevalent in NSFW fics.

4. **Explicit Themes**: These fics may explore explicit themes such as BDSM, fetishism, or other unconventional sexual practices.

5. **Abusive Relationships**: NSFW fics may contain depictions of abusive or unhealthy relationships, which can include emotional, physical, or psychological abuse.

6. **Non-Consensual Content**: Some NSFW fics may feature non-consensual or dubiously consensual sexual encounters, which can be disturbing or triggering.

7. **Drug and Substance Use**: The use of drugs or substances for recreational purposes may be portrayed in NSFW fics.

8. **Age-Restricted Content**: Content involving characters who are minors in explicit situations is a clear characteristic of NSFW content and is illegal in many jurisdictions.

9. **Fetish Content**: NSFW fics may explore specific fetishes or kinks, which can vary widely and may include BDSM, foot fetishes, or others.

10. **Erotic Literature**: NSFW fics may have a primary focus on eroticism, sensuality, and arousal.





# Regulations:

The fic MUST have the NSFW tag and a warning label.

Just copy paste this at the top of your fic (after the --- of the template)

## Rules of consnet

The age of consnet in this fic is 18 and all characters have to be over 18 to perform/encouter/view. If you are going to write about a sexual situation with another persons OC you must request their consent. As tzar sais "To prevent forced sexy times and that stuff".



## How far can you go?

In my writing, I've made the deliberate choice not to include explicit clop scenes, as I believe they often don't significantly contribute to the depth of the narrative. However, I want to emphasize that this decision doesn't restrict any other contributors from incorporating such elements if they wish. It's important, though, to find a balance between these explicit scenes and the wholesome aspects of the story. To maintain this balance, I propose a guideline: no more than three consecutive clop chapters per commit and they genuinely must enhance the overall storyline.

Additional Note:

It's worth noting that this rule doesn't prevent the exploration of any other topics besides gore, grimdark, or extreme violence. Themes of a sexual or explicit nature are acceptable, as long as they are presented within the context of the narrative and contribute meaningfully to the story's development.

# NSFW Submissions Titles:
All pull requests must have the NSFW tag eg "[NSFW] - Chapter X - Char x Char" eg "[NSFW] - Chapter 1 - Tzar x Snek"
The same naming conventions and tags remain
