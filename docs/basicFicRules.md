# Fic file naming.​

The file name should be chapter-X.md X being the chapter number eg one, two, four etc EG. chapter-one.md
How to add fics?

# Template"
Next on your fork: Go to blogs --> year0 then hit add file --> create new file.

Then paste this template in:
```
---
slug: chapter-one-TITLE
title: "Year 0 Chapter X: TITLE"
authors:
  name: username
  title: title/rank
  url: https://github.com/<YOURGITHUB USERNAME>
  image_url: <image url>
tags: [year0, Snek, SFW, Pov, USA]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---


<fic text here>
```
Most of these are self explanitory. The authors section should be who wrote the fic. Tags are up to you but they should follow the format of 
[year, Chars, SFW/NSFW, Pov/3rdperson, Locations, subtags] 

Examples would include
```
[year1, Snek, Tzar, NSFW, Mix-Pov, USA, their-house, country-side]
[year50, Jacko, EE, NSFW, Mix-Pov, USA, EE-parents-house, country-side, fetish, gag]
```
Do not tag like this: [year50, Jacko, EE, NSFW, Mix-Pov, USA, EE-PRAENTS-House, countrySide] if its multiple words use a dash

Want to add images?​

use this format if the image does not belong to you
```
![Alt text](IMAGE URL "a title")
Image belongs to their original authors. Source: <URL/WEBPAGE>
```
Or use this format if the image belongs to you
```
![Alt text](IMAGE URL "a title")
```


# NSFW Inserts?
If it is really important to the storry you may add inserts to a middle of the storry to refrence something frmo the NSFW Section. It should have a smooth transition
Eg
I opened the door

*Insert: Year 10 Chapter 2 - The time in the bedroom with Vogia*

Then i excited the room like a happy stallion.

Inserts would be biascally checking another section for that extra chapter. Inserts should not force you to read a new section and should flow.

# Want to write for another year/timespam?​

Place your cursor in the "year0" box and then press backspace.

Your cursor should now be inside the "year0" box.

Once your cursor is in the box, you can change "year0" to the desired year, for example, "year45."

Next, press "/".

Once it looks like this, you can create the first chapter for that year. Don't forget to follow the naming conventions!
