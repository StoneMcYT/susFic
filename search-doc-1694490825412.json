[{"title":"Chapter one: Fox's Pumkins","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-fox","content":"info WIP CHAPTER Dr. Swag Fox stared at the voluptuous pumpkins, for years he had been tormented by an undying curse that would melt each one in his very hands with a mere touch. But this time was different. Freed from his anguish after accepting EE into the neutral blep server, he was finally free. At the front of the grocery store laid a carton what once scourged his very soul. Hesitating to grasp the top one, he asked himself if he was truly free. Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst, he squeezed his eyes shut and lunged at its epicarp with an unceremonious jolt. Flinching back out of what had become second nature, he slowly turned back, and stared in amazement as... nothing happened. The pumpkin had not so much as a blemish on it. Finally, after what had felt like a lifetime of rending torment, he was free to enjoy his pumpkins once more. And enjoy he would. He spent hours at that grocery store, carefully inspecting each one. He marveled at the sight, enjoying each touch, wondering if it was all a dream. It wasn't. At the warning of the store's closing, he was ready. He had picked the perfectly ripe, plump, practically neon-orange, pumpkin. Its form shone in the store's artificial lighting; a paragon of hope in his formerly bleak world. With the utmost care, he brought it through the store, and drove him, all the why imagining what he would do with it. By the time he had come home, it was night. Freshly fallen snow covered the ground, the familiarly cold air biting at him in a way that comforted him, like a loving nip that betrayed any expectations of an unbearable frost. It reminded him of hiking, and as he stared at his pumpkin, he was filled with an overwhelming joy. He knew exactly what he was going to do with this pumpkin. Living in Vermon' doesn't leave you without skills. Expertly, he carved a single, circular hole in the pumpkin As its warm, fleshy insides beckoned him, he undid his belt with bated breath and lowered his pants with fervor.[13:40]He ran to his bathroom, tired from a a day of work and his time in the grocery store. As much as he loved the snow, nothing felt better than a warm bath. He languished in its warm embrace while his mind raced with thoughts, impatiently anticipating what was to come. He stepped out, toweled off, and dressed himself formally. He was a doctor and he was swag, after all. Once again using his Vermon'ean skills, he carefully scooped out the pulp, and tenderly prepared a picturesque jack-o'-lantern. Grabbing his best candle, he lovingly lit it, and happily placed it inside his pumpkin. It glowed wonderfully. He stepped back out into the cold Vermon'ean air, and placed at his porch, ready to greet anypony who happened to pass by. He stared at his work with pride, and went back inside. The pulp, what to do with the pulp, he asked himself. As he thought fondly of the day, he could think of nothing better than a warm pumpkin cider. With the grace of a three-star Lunaist chef, he prepared the cider in the traditional bat-pony manner, the perfect drink, to the end the perfect day. He donned a warm pegasus-feather scarf, and stepped back out, once more welcomed by the frosty air. He sat down on his porch's bench, and admired the scene. The rural Vermon'ean sky shone with Luna's countless stars. His pumpkin had illuminated the scene in a warm, fiery orange that seemed to soothe his very soul. And as fresh snow fell, he couldn't help but appreciate how perfectly, uniquely ethereal each one was. Snowdrop's legacy had not gone forgotten by the pegasai. And as the wind gave him a final love-nip, he grasped his glass mug with trembling paws, overjoyed at the perfection before him. He let out a small tear of joy, silently hoping nopony saw, and gave the cider his first sip. It really was perfect. He sat there, and awaited his friends. One by one, they came. Pro, anti, or neutral, dozens came by to enjoy a glass of cider with him.[13:40]It really was the perfect ending to the perfect night.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Year 23 Chapter One: New Beginnings","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-new-beginnings","content":"info This is an early chapter one draft so we can publish the webpage early and get everyone on the same system.

Date: 2nd January Year 23 It was one dark morning when I woke up in some unknown cave with a bright shining glowing orb in the center. I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I've got wings now. When I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I'm small, I'm a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here. I rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/susFic/blog/chapter-two-castle","content":"info Date: 2nd January Year 23 Dammit, I cursed to myself; my legs are screaming while the guards chased after me. Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. shorning? No, Shining. That's right, Shining, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. &quot;YES, I'M FLYING!&quot; I screamed out for the world to see. Dammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Shining holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me. The hay, I have done nothing wrong. The orange one knocked me in the head, and all went dark. Hours Later: I wake up cold, tired, and hungry but comfortable. My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels. &quot;Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!&quot; Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony. &quot;Ummm, Hi, I'm Snek,&quot; I calmly replied. &quot;Sorry about your head; Flash wasn’t meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away,&quot; Twilight calmly said. Twilight's horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade. &quot;Better?&quot; the unicorn-Pegasus inquired. &quot;Indeed, thank you,&quot; I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh? The noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. His deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, &quot;Guards cuff him.” The guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, &quot;That will not be necessary; Snek won't cause any harm to the palace or me.&quot; I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, &quot;But love-&quot;. Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence &quot;it will be fine.&quot; The orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin. The white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. &quot;Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria. I'm Celestia; on my left sits Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.”","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Year X Chapter 1: A morning with a Royal Princess","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-morning-with-royal-princess","content":"danger This chapter is has a NSFW insertion. However, the chapter does not have any nsfw content in itsself Slowly, I become conscious. I was absolutely drained from the long day of work I had yesterday, and it left me powerless when I got home. Of course, coming home to a beautiful royal princess was always the highlight of my day, and it gave me a little high before I inevitably crashed onto the bed and passed out. No matter the day I had, she always has a way of brightening my mood. I truly am the luckiest pony there is on this planet. My eyes still closed, my mind starts rummaging through its internal storage to take inventory of what todays things to do are. Immediately, I remember the absolute beauty laying right next to me. The thought of this makes my heart flutter quicker than a blink of the eye. My eyes shoot open, looking at the ceiling. That’s not where I want to look, obviously. I gently roll over to my left, being careful to possibly not awaken the royalty laying beside me. As I thought, she’s passed out. Hooves laid out beside her elegantly, her muzzle gently rests tucked into her front hooves. Her mane laying against the pillow with utmost grace, her horn proudly standing tall despite this. I’m now laying on my side, simply admiring her absolute humbling beauty. Looking at her closed eyes, her ears, horn, muzzle, mane, chest, as much as I could see. I slowly pan down to admire the rest of her. Her body, wings, hooves, tail. She had fallen asleep without the covers, I’m guessing she also was pretty tired. It gave me a perfect view of her entire presence. Convenient, if I do say so myself. I look down at myself, hooves and fur clean from the shower last night. I just want to make sure I am physically up to par for this lovely lady. After all, she is royalty.. she only deserves the best. I am a bit sore, my job is quite physical. Nothing I can’t handle, but I sure could use a massage. 5 minutes go by, which seems like an eternity. I could stare at her forever. Impatience starts to get to me. I just want to talk to her. I know I should let her sleep, but its torture for me. I hope she won’t be mad.. I take a hoof and gently boop her on her snout. “Love.” I say, as soft and gentle as I can. Nothing, she’s out cold. Ugh, I feel so bad. I reach out once more with another boop, this time a little more firm. “Love.” I say again. Her head slowly moves back, she lets out a cute little sigh. “Hey, are you awake?” I say with guilt. She puts a hoof over her snout and itches it. Her eyes squint as she tries to wake herself up. I’m simply laying here, admiring every movement. Its something words truly can’t describe. After a little bit of adjusting, her eyes open. My breath is taken away, her beautiful blue eyes level me every single time. She takes a moment to get her mind right, but quickly greets me with a genuine, passionate smile. “Good morning baby girl.” I say with a blush. “Good morning my love,” she replies. “How did you sleep?”. She asks happily. I had to think for a second about this, some things we’re still a blur to me. “Honestly, I was out like a light. Work had me so tired yesterday.. how about you?”. She giggles, “I know you we’re, you fell asleep almost immediately.. we only got to talk for 30 minutes before you checked out, I missed you.” My heart almost explodes. “Aww, I’m sorry.. I hope you slept well though, I see you also fell asleep suddenly.” I say with a flirty smirk. She smiles brighter. “I sure did, I stayed up a bit studying some ancient artifacts from a book I found.. I’ll have to tell you all about it. After that, I was exhausted. I laid down and I guess that was it.” she chuckled. “You’re adorable, I’d love to hear all about it.” I say with love. She blushes slightly at this. “Maybe, but you’re more adorable..” she teases back. I couldn’t handle it, I bury my head into my hooves and let out a slight squeal of happiness. Yes, while I am a stallion, I get giddy at compliments/affection like that. My love language mainly is words of affirmation. Even despite that, she just makes me feel so small sometimes, and I love it. Seeing me bury my head away, she scoots over closer and puts her front hooves around my head, and pulls me into her soft chest. I sink in like I’m in a cloud and surrender myself. I love her. I love her so much. Emotions of this magnitude simply can’t be put into good enough words. Laying in her chest is one of the best things I could ever imagine. She gently rests her muzzle and head on top of mine. I am hers. She’s the only pony I could ever want. What’s even better is that she’s all mine. How this happened is beyond me, but it seems the stars have aligned.. which, funny that, she control’s those. Did she plan this out? Who knows, what matters is we’re here right now. “Luna.” I say with butterflies flying around my insides. “Yes sweetheart?” she replies with a soft, passionate tone. “I, I.. I love you.” The words come out with a stutter due to my immense shyness. Its hard for me to communicate just how I feel sometimes. Luna lets out a real soft and cute squee of emotion. She nuzzles the top of my head with hers and squeezes me with her hooves. “I love you too dear.. you mean the world to me.” I melt further into her soft chest, feeling so warm and cozy. I’m safe here, this is the only place I want to be. There is just one problem.. Insertion: An amazing morning with a Royal Princess With the bed tidied up, I crawl back onto it. Luna welcomes me immediately with open hooves, and a warm smile on her face. Her cheeks still red, as are mine. “Come here you.” she purrs. How could I not. I gently get on top of her, and surrender. She wraps her hooves around me tightly and squeezes. My heart hurts from all the love I feel, but its so worth it. “I love you so much.” I blurt out. I do, I really do. She giggles cutely, and nuzzles my head with hers. “I love you even more.. you really know how to make a mare happy.” “Meh, I try. You know, its hard with you being royalty and all..” I joke. She takes offense in a flirtatious way. “Excuse me?? I’m not THAT hard to please..” she says with another smirk. “Yeah, you’re right. I got pretty lucky.” I nuzzle her chest. Its so soft, like a blanket from heaven. Suddenly, my stomach growls. I’m hungry, turns out making love works up an appetite. “Um, I’m hungry.” I say quietly. “When is breakfast..?”. Luna laughs lovingly. “Whenever you want sweetheart.. if you want breakfast now, I’ll make you whatever you wish.” Yep, I’m spoiled. A royal princess willing to make anything for me? I won the lottery. “Umm.. pancakes.. that sounds great to me.” I say. Luna giggles softly. “Pancakes it is, cutie pie. Lets go make some.” She rubs me on the head. She’s so comfortable, I don’t want to get off. I could stay here forever if I didn’t have to eat. “I don’t want to get off..” I say with a sad, cute tone. “I could stay here all day long with you too, but you have to eat. I don’t want you being hungry. Besides, we should shower..” she suggests. She’s right, we need to shower. A towel isn’t enough to clean us up especially after what we just did. “Fine..” I say. “I’ll get up, I guess..” and so I did. I got up, and gave her a hoof off the bed. We both trotted to the kitchen, where we prepared breakfast, all while flirting and showing affection to each other. You could say I’m living the dream, in which I will tell you, you are right..","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Year X Chapter 1: An amazing morning with a Royal Princess","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/susFic/nsfw/chapter-one-morning-with-royal-princess","content":"","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"An amazing morning with a Royal Princess​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Year X Chapter 1: An amazing morning with a Royal Princess","url":"/susFic/nsfw/chapter-one-morning-with-royal-princess#an-amazing-morning-with-a-royal-princess","content":"The issue is, whenever I get deeply intimate with someone, I get, turned on.. even if I just say something really sweet, I end up getting hard. I’ve always been this way, I’m not sure why it happens but it does. Since she woke up I’ve been a little erect, but after this, I’m rock hard. I’m so hard in fact it hurts. After what she just said, I’m all messed up. My emotions are turned up to the max and my throbbing erection only confirms that. Luna doesn’t know this happens to me yet, but I have a feeling she’s going to find out soon.. Luna pulls me in even closer than I already am somehow. “Are you okay my love?” She asks with cute concern. I pause. Do I be honest, or do I lie? Honestly I really want to tell her how I feel, but I don’t want her to judge me negatively. I don’t think she would, but it’s a chance I’m afraid to take. “Um, yeah, I’m fine. I’m just really.. really happy.” I say hesitantly. I really want to say it, but I’m so nervous. “Okay, just making sure. I know you get really emotional, and its adorable.. but I’m just checking. I wouldn’t change it one bit, and if I’m being honest myself, you got me feeling really strong emotions as well..” she giggles. Alright, that’s it. I have to tell her. It seems she’s somewhat on the same page as me, I think.. I’m just gonna have to tackle my fear. We haven’t had sex yet, since we waited for marriage to have it. Imagine being me for this long, holding it in. I have to say something, whether it fails or not. “Luna, I have something to admit.” This is it, the Hail Mary of statements. “You can tell me anything my love, what is it?” she replies, as she starts rubbing my back with her hoof, the other one holding me against her tightly. “Whenever we cuddle or say sweet things to each other, I get, um.. hard.. its always been this way, and right now I’m so hard it hurts. I’m sorry, but I just love you so much and I find you so attractive that its not possible to stop it.” I bury my face farther away from her head. I’m embarrassed, my face is burning alive. I’m afraid she’s not going to take it well for some reason. Luna lets out a little sigh, a good one it seems.. like a loving sigh, like she’s relieved I said that. My heart is racing, not only from being intimate with her like this but from the question I just asked. She takes in a soft, deep breath. “Yeah? Is that so..” she giggles, this time with a hint of flirtation. “Well, that is really cute. I never knew you felt so strongly like that before..” My mind is racing at this point. She accepted it, but now what. Now what happens? “Yeah.. I do. I-“ I stop. I don’t want to be too pushy. Luna is a very elegant princess. She is very mature and relaxed, I’m scared that if I push to far and she’s not ready, I’ll end up ruining what we have. Yes, we’re married, but that doesn’t mean things can’t change. “You can tell me anything love, I told you.. I love you.” She insists. I stay buried into her chest, pretty much frozen in my tracks. I’ve actually lost some of my erection due to my adverse emotions at this point. I feel like giving up. I think Luna senses this. She gently moves her front hooves to my shoulders and guides me away from her chest, so she could look me in the eyes. I look up hesitantly, only to be captured by the most stunning eyes I have ever seen. So big, so blue, filled with total admiration and love.. all for me. Star struck, I try to remember what I was trying to say in the first place. Luckily, she took the initiative. “Hey, I’m serious. Its okay.. I find it adorable, and quite honestly, that’s kind of hot.” My cheeks light up once again. The fur on the back of my neck stands up, and I feel so hot I could start a fire. Her face grows a little bit of what seems to be a flirtatious smirk. I try and find words as fast as I can. “Well, uh.. I’m glad you do.” I feel myself getting rock hard again. At this point, I’m dripping precum. “I really want you..” Luna’s expressions goes full smug. Her eyes suggesting the same. “I was hoping you’d say that.. I wasn’t sure exactly where you we’re going with this, but now that I know.. I think its time we finally, you know..” She says with a wink. An electric shock runs down my body like lightning. This is it. I did it. The moment I’ve been waiting for is about to happen. “Yeah, I think so too..” I say with passion. I’m shaking, nervousness and anxiety now flood me. She’s calm, with a cool demeanor, which is so.. damn.. sexy. Her eyes showing me that she’s ready to give me the time of my life, and that she wants me to do the same for her. She puts a hoof up to my cheek, and starts to lean in. The time is now. I lean in as well, both of us closing our eyes as our muzzles and lips gently meet in the middle, on the soft bed. Another shock runs down my body, my erection somehow harder than ever before. Truth be told, that part of the bed has got to be a little wet. I gently stick my tongue into her mouth, lovingly lapping it around hers. I put my front right hoof on her cheek as well, keeping her right where I want her. We lock together, passionately French kissing. This we’ve done before, but in this context its different. I’m finally going to be able to have sex with her, and its flooding my mind. The emotions rushing through my head are just too great for me to be gentle. I feel like I’m about to explode. I want her, and I’m going to really show her. I suddenly but swiftly release my lips from hers. Her eyes open, assessing the situation. I’m calm, cool and calculated, despite the intense emotions I am undergoing. I put all 4 hooves square on the bed and get up, moving my body over hers, and laying her flat on her back. Her facial expression shows shock at first, but once she realizes what I’m doing, her smug expression returns in a greater fashion. Her hooves spread apart, front and rear, revealing her royal plot. I don’t want to be as indecent just yet, so I don’t look, but I can tell one thing: she is REALLY wet. The light of the room reflects it in the corner of my eye. No matter, I’ll get to that in a bit. I rest my body on top of hers, and lean in once again to continue our kisses I suddenly interrupted. The passion this time burns brighter. She liked that move I just did. Both of her front hooves wrap around the back of my neck as I lap my tongue around hers just like before. Passionate, wet kissing, with a gorgeous royal mare. My body on hers, my throbbing erection finds its way right on top of her wet mare pussy. Now I knew for sure how wet she really was. She lets out a slight moan as she feels it there. We continue kissing for a minute or two, really getting into it. This time, she pushes me away, and with admiring eyes says “I want you in me. Please, fuck me. I’m ready..”. Her cheeks flush red, her eyes fully open now. For the third time a shock runs down my body, third times the charm. “As you command, princess..” I say in a really seductive tone. I line my body up to put it in, but I look at her first, ready to say the words as she steals what I was about to say. “I love you Jesse.” She says, her words filled with warm, absolute love and emotion. I almost melt, but remember what I’m about to do. “I love you too Luna..” I reply. She closes her eyes, ready for me. I look down, and slowly direct my erection into her. The tip slides in with ease, right between her pussy lips. She lets out a slight moan again. I slowly and gently go in deeper. She’s tight, I’m the only pony who’s ever been inside of her. He inner warmth graces my throbbing erection like a blanket, but with a nice twist of wetness. I let out a slight moan myself, she feels so good.. and I’m barely in her. I put some more force into my hips, and feel my erection going deeper, spreading the insides of her plot. I’m already close to cumming, but I know I can’t do her like that. Her head and eyes lean back, along with her ears. Her beautiful dark blue body tenses up as well, and her bottom hooves spring up in the air, further proving the immense pleasure she is feeling. I close my eyes and bite the lower part of my lip. I go even deeper, with each inch ready to blow a hot load of stallion semen inside of her. “Ugh yes!!” She suddenly exclaims loudly. “You feel so good baby.. please fuck your princess!”. I suddenly thrust fully into her. My whole stallion dick inside. She moans louder than ever, and I do the same. “I got you love, take me. Take all of me.” I say with determination. I pull a bit out, then thrust back in. Over and over, deep, with all the love and passion my heart has for her. Her and I moan at every thrust. Her pussy drips all over the bed, leaving a giant wet spot that is constantly expanding. Her pussy fills with my precum, as I try my very best to not cum just yet. I put my front hooves closer to her head. Full missionary mode. The bed rocks with my back and forth movements. Her eyes squinted close, head back, ears down, body tight, face beet red. My eyes admiring her body, and my whole body tensed up as well. My heart is jumping out of my chest, feeling nothing but the strongest sense of love I have ever felt. Back and forth I go, my stallion erection spreading open her royal plot more and more with every thrust. Luna opens her eyes, locking with mine. As I thrust in and out, her eyes tell me she loves me, and that I am all she wants. I look down, my erection soaking wet with her essence. Its all over both of us. I look back, put a hoof over her muzzle and suddenly thrust really hard and deep.. deeper than ever. Her eyes immediately shut again as she lets out a muffled moan. This was enough to seal the deal. I couldn’t hold it anymore. “Babe, I’m about to cum..” I say through deep breaths. I take my hoof off her muzzle as she opens her eyes and looks at me. “So am I.. I’m really close.” She admits through heavy breathing as well. “Please cum in me.. make me yours. I want you to fill me up with your hot stallion cum..” My heart flutters once more. “Anything for you..” I reply, thrusting in and out of her hard and deep. We lock eye contact once more, her eyes wanting to roll back but she fights it. I feel the orgasm sensation begin to rush through me, building with every thrust. My face tenses up, as so does my body. She sees this and knows what’s about to happen. “Cum for me baby, cum for me.. fill me with that hot cum!”. Her words encourage me further. All of a sudden an unstoppable wave flows through me, I’m about to cum. “I’m cumming love, I’m cumming!” I say loudly, my breath taken away by the sensation. My erection swells inside of her rapidly, and suddenly shoots hot loads of my semen inside of her. The orgasm is so strong it hurts. I let out a really loud moan, as I continue to fill her up. Each cum shot flooding me with a warm feeling of satisfaction, as I’m sure its the same for her. “Mmmmmmmmmmm..” she moans. “Ugh that feels so good, I feel your warm cum inside me..” I continue thrusting until my tip gets sensitive. I’m breathing really heavily now. Although I didn’t last very long, that orgasm took a lot out of me. I look at her with big, passionate eyes, trying to regain strength so I could talk properly. “Do you need to cum still love?” I muster up. I didn’t want to leave her hanging, that’s just not right. I wanted her to share the same experience I had. “I’m almost there..” she replies, trying to keep her composure. “Okay, I’ll help you.” I say with a wink. I pull out of her, my stallion dick dripping with her wetness and my cum. Her pussy drips the rest of my cum that floods her insides. We smile at each other with bright red faces, heavily in love. I move my body further down, putting my front hooves right at her hips. “Mmmm, what are you going to do to me love?” She purrs. Without saying, I show her, by putting my right hoof gently onto her plot, slowly and intimately rubbing it back and forth, in a clockwise circular motion. She moans and tenses up again, closing her eyes and biting her lip this time as I lap around her mare pussy with my hoof. Its throbbing, I can tell she’s also ready to cum. I get down a little lower, and without her realizing I stick my tongue out and lick her clit. Gently licking up and down as I keep rubbing her. She moans a bit louder, starting to squirm a bit. Her legs rest beside my head and start to squeeze against me as she twitches. I look up at her, my tongue still on her clit, watching her expressions as I please her. I can see it, she’s ready. Her facial expressions become more pronounced the more I rub and lick her. “Ugh, I’m gonna cum! I’m gonna cum please keep going!!” She cries out with joy. I move my hoof faster around her plot as she moans more consistently, twitching even more. I use my other hoof to hold her down, as I start sucking on her clit. I want her to cum, I want to please her. “Cum for me princess.” I say passionately. Her pussy throbs as she lets out one final moan, then jolts her body as her white essence comes spilling out, along with mine. So much cum comes out of her beautiful wet mare pussy, it runs down her ass and onto the bed. Her body then relaxes, as she takes really deep breaths to recover. “Mmmmmm, someone had fun, hm?” I say teasingly. She lets out a delightful sigh and looks down at me. “Yeah, I did.. you wore me out..” she laughs lovingly. “Now we have to clean up, I want to cuddle you, silly goose.” she teases back. “Ah yes, I can’t miss the cuddles..” I say with a smile. I move back up her body, and lean in for a quick, passionate kiss. We lock lips for about 5 seconds, enjoying the moment. I get up and off the bed, the lower part of me soaked with our fluids. I trot over to grab a towel from the bathroom, and return back to help us clean up. As I walk back in the room, Luna has a glow to her I’ve never seen before. She’s full of passion, more than ever before. I gently get on the bed, towel in my mouth. I lay it over her plot and begin to rub it around with my hoof. She jumps at this a bit, still being sensitive from the massive orgasm she just had. “A bit sensitive, are we?” I tease.

He also has control over natural disasters such as storms and hurricanes. He also possesses a power of regeneration, which allows him to generate very quickly from any injury, this power can also heal injuries that others might have, even more advanced stuff like being blind. He understands any language as if he were a native. His status also makes him partly immortal. Notes: Personality-wise, he has a tendency to flirt with anyone, often wanting to get into the pants of everyone he talks to.

However, I want to emphasize that this decision doesn't restrict any other contributors from incorporating such elements if they wish. It's important, though, to find a balance between these explicit scenes and the wholesome aspects of the story. To maintain this balance, I propose a guideline: no more than three consecutive clop chapters per commit and they genuinely must enhance the overall storyline. Additional Note: It's worth noting that this rule doesn't prevent the exploration of any other topics besides gore, grimdark, or extreme violence. Themes of a sexual or explicit nature are acceptable, as long as they are presented within the context of the narrative and contribute meaningfully to the story's development.
