However, the chapter does not have any nsfw content in itsself\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\nSlowly, I become conscious. I was absolutely drained from the long day of work I had yesterday, and it left me powerless when I got home. Of course, coming home to a beautiful royal princess was always the highlight of my day, and it gave me a little high before I inevitably crashed onto the bed and passed out. No matter the day I had, she always has a way of brightening my mood. I truly am the luckiest pony there is on this planet. \\n\\nMy eyes still closed, my mind starts rummaging through its internal storage to take inventory of what todays things to do are. Immediately, I remember the absolute beauty laying right next to me. The thought of this makes my heart flutter quicker than a blink of the eye. My eyes shoot open, looking at the ceiling. That\u2019s not where I want to look, obviously. I gently roll over to my left, being careful to possibly not awaken the royalty laying beside me. As I thought, she\u2019s passed out. Hooves laid out beside her elegantly, her muzzle gently rests tucked into her front hooves. Her mane laying against the pillow with utmost grace, her horn proudly standing tall despite this. I\u2019m now laying on my side, simply admiring her absolute humbling beauty. Looking at her closed eyes, her ears, horn, muzzle, mane, chest, as much as I could see. I slowly pan down to admire the rest of her. Her body, wings, hooves, tail. She had fallen asleep without the covers, I\u2019m guessing she also was pretty tired. It gave me a perfect view of her entire presence. Convenient, if I do say so myself. I look down at myself, hooves and fur clean from the shower last night. I just want to make sure I am physically up to par for this lovely lady. After all, she is royalty.. she only deserves the best. I am a bit sore, my job is quite physical. Nothing I can\u2019t handle, but I sure could use a massage. 5 minutes go by, which seems like an eternity. I could stare at her forever. Impatience starts to get to me. I just want to talk to her. I know I should let her sleep, but its torture for me. I hope she won\u2019t be mad.. \\n\\nI take a hoof and gently boop her on her snout. \u201cLove.\u201d I say, as soft and gentle as I can. Nothing, she\u2019s out cold. Ugh, I feel so bad. I reach out once more with another boop, this time a little more firm. \u201cLove.\u201d I say again. Her head slowly moves back, she lets out a cute little sigh. \u201cHey, are you awake?\u201d I say with guilt. She puts a hoof over her snout and itches it. Her eyes squint as she tries to wake herself up. I\u2019m simply laying here, admiring every movement. Its something words truly can\u2019t describe. After a little bit of adjusting, her eyes open. My breath is taken away, her beautiful blue eyes level me every single time. She takes a moment to get her mind right, but quickly greets me with a genuine, passionate smile. \u201cGood morning baby girl.\u201d I say with a blush. \u201cGood morning my love,\u201d she replies. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d. She asks happily. I had to think for a second about this, some things we\u2019re still a blur to me. \u201cHonestly, I was out like a light. Work had me so tired yesterday.. how about you?\u201d. She giggles, \u201cI know you we\u2019re, you fell asleep almost immediately.. we only got to talk for 30 minutes before you checked out, I missed you.\u201d My heart almost explodes. \u201cAww, I\u2019m sorry.. I hope you slept well though, I see you also fell asleep suddenly.\u201d I say with a flirty smirk. She smiles brighter. \u201cI sure did, I stayed up a bit studying some ancient artifacts from a book I found.. I\u2019ll have to tell you all about it. After that, I was exhausted. I laid down and I guess that was it.\u201d she chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable, I\u2019d love to hear all about it.\u201d I say with love. She blushes slightly at this. \u201cMaybe, but you\u2019re more adorable..\u201d she teases back. I couldn\u2019t handle it, I bury my head into my hooves and let out a slight squeal of happiness. Yes, while I am a stallion, I get giddy at compliments/affection like that. My love language mainly is words of affirmation. Even despite that, she just makes me feel so small sometimes, and I love it. Seeing me bury my head away, she scoots over closer and puts her front hooves around my head, and pulls me into her soft chest. I sink in like I\u2019m in a cloud and surrender myself. I love her. I love her so much. Emotions of this magnitude simply can\u2019t be put into good enough words. \\n\\nLaying in her chest is one of the best things I could ever imagine. She gently rests her muzzle and head on top of mine. I am hers. She\u2019s the only pony I could ever want. What\u2019s even better is that she\u2019s all mine. How this happened is beyond me, but it seems the stars have aligned.. which, funny that, she control\u2019s those. Did she plan this out? Who knows, what matters is we\u2019re here right now. \u201cLuna.\u201d I say with butterflies flying around my insides. \u201cYes sweetheart?\u201d she replies with a soft, passionate tone. \u201cI, I.. I love you.\u201d The words come out with a stutter due to my immense shyness. Its hard for me to communicate just how I feel sometimes. Luna lets out a real soft and cute squee of emotion. She nuzzles the top of my head with hers and squeezes me with her hooves. \u201cI love you too dear.. you mean the world to me.\u201d I melt further into her soft chest, feeling so warm and cozy. I\u2019m safe here, this is the only place I want to be. There is just one problem.. \\n\\n*Insertion: An amazing morning with a Royal Princess*\\n\\nWith the bed tidied up, I crawl back onto it. Luna welcomes me immediately with open hooves, and a warm smile on her face. Her cheeks still red, as are mine. \u201cCome here you.\u201d she purrs. How could I not. I gently get on top of her, and surrender. She wraps her hooves around me tightly and squeezes. My heart hurts from all the love I feel, but its so worth it. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d I blurt out. I do, I really do. She giggles cutely, and nuzzles my head with hers. \u201cI love you even more.. you really know how to make a mare happy.\u201d \u201cMeh, I try. You know, its hard with you being royalty and all..\u201d I joke. She takes offense in a flirtatious way. \u201cExcuse me?? I\u2019m not THAT hard to please..\u201d she says with another smirk. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I got pretty lucky.\u201d I nuzzle her chest. Its so soft, like a blanket from heaven. Suddenly, my stomach growls. I\u2019m hungry, turns out making love works up an appetite. \u201cUm, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d I say quietly. \u201cWhen is breakfast..?\u201d. Luna laughs lovingly. \u201cWhenever you want sweetheart.. if you want breakfast now, I\u2019ll make you whatever you wish.\u201d Yep, I\u2019m spoiled. A royal princess willing to make anything for me? I won the lottery. \u201cUmm.. pancakes.. that sounds great to me.\u201d I say. Luna giggles softly. \u201cPancakes it is, cutie pie. Lets go make some.\u201d She rubs me on the head. She\u2019s so comfortable, I don\u2019t want to get off. I could stay here forever if I didn\u2019t have to eat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get off..\u201d I say with a sad, cute tone. \u201cI could stay here all day long with you too, but you have to eat. I don\u2019t want you being hungry. Besides, we should shower..\u201d she suggests. She\u2019s right, we need to shower. A towel isn\u2019t enough to clean us up especially after what we just did. \u201cFine..\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll get up, I guess..\u201d and so I did. I got up, and gave her a hoof off the bed. We both trotted to the kitchen, where we prepared breakfast, all while flirting and showing affection to each other. You could say I\u2019m living the dream, in which I will tell you, you are right.."},{"id":"chapter-one-fox","metadata":{"permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-fox","editUrl":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT/susFic/tree/main/blog/other/chapter-one-fox.md","source":"@site/blog/other/chapter-one-fox.md","title":"Chapter one: Fox\'s Pumkins","description":"WIP CHAPTER","date":"2023-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 11, 2023","tags":[{"label":"sfw","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/sfw"},{"label":"ee","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/ee"},{"label":"fox","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/fox"},{"label":"unrelatedFromMainlore","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/unrelated-from-mainlore"}],"readingTime":3.61,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chapter-one-fox","title":"Chapter one: Fox\'s Pumkins","tags":["sfw","ee","fox","unrelatedFromMainlore"],"date":"2023-09-11T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Year X Chapter 1: A morning with a Royal Princess","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-morning-with-royal-princess"},"nextItem":{"title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-two-castle"}},"content":":::info\\n\\nWIP CHAPTER\\n:::\\n\\nDr. Swag Fox stared at the voluptuous pumpkins, for years he had been tormented by an undying curse that would melt each one in his very hands with a mere touch. But this time was different. Freed from his anguish after accepting EE into the neutral blep server, he was finally free. At the front of the grocery store laid a carton what once scourged his very soul. Hesitating to grasp the top one, he asked himself if he was truly free.\\n\\nHoping for the best, preparing for the worst, he squeezed his eyes shut and lunged at its epicarp with an unceremonious jolt. Flinching back out of what had become second nature, he slowly turned back, and stared in amazement as... nothing happened. The pumpkin had not so much as a blemish on it. Finally, after what had felt like a lifetime of rending torment, he was free to enjoy his pumpkins once more.\\n\\nAnd enjoy he would. He spent hours at that grocery store, carefully inspecting each one. He marveled at the sight, enjoying each touch, wondering if it was all a dream. It wasn\'t. At the warning of the store\'s closing, he was ready. He had picked the perfectly ripe, plump, practically neon-orange, pumpkin. Its form shone in the store\'s artificial lighting; a paragon of hope in his formerly bleak world. With the utmost care, he brought it through the store, and drove him, all the why imagining what he would do with it.\\n\\nBy the time he had come home, it was night. Freshly fallen snow covered the ground, the familiarly cold air biting at him in a way that comforted him, like a loving nip that betrayed any expectations of an unbearable frost. It reminded him of hiking, and as he stared at his pumpkin, he was filled with an overwhelming joy. He knew exactly what he was going to do with this pumpkin.\\n\\nLiving in Vermon\' doesn\'t leave you without skills. Expertly, he carved a single, circular hole in the pumpkin As its warm, fleshy insides beckoned him, he undid his belt with bated breath and lowered his pants with fervor.\\n[13:40]\\nHe ran to his bathroom, tired from a a day of work and his time in the grocery store. As much as he loved the snow, nothing felt better than a warm bath. He languished in its warm embrace while his mind raced with thoughts, impatiently anticipating what was to come. He stepped out, toweled off, and dressed himself formally. He was a doctor and he was swag, after all.\\n\\nOnce again using his Vermon\'ean skills, he carefully scooped out the pulp, and tenderly prepared a picturesque jack-o\'-lantern. Grabbing his best candle, he lovingly lit it, and happily placed it inside his pumpkin. It glowed wonderfully. He stepped back out into the cold Vermon\'ean air, and placed at his porch, ready to greet anypony who happened to pass by.\\n\\nHe stared at his work with pride, and went back inside. The pulp, what to do with the pulp, he asked himself. As he thought fondly of the day, he could think of nothing better than a warm pumpkin cider. With the grace of a three-star Lunaist chef, he prepared the cider in the traditional bat-pony manner, the perfect drink, to the end the perfect day.\\n\\nHe donned a warm pegasus-feather scarf, and stepped back out, once more welcomed by the frosty air. He sat down on his porch\'s bench, and admired the scene. The rural Vermon\'ean sky shone with Luna\'s countless stars. His pumpkin had illuminated the scene in a warm, fiery orange that seemed to soothe his very soul. And as fresh snow fell, he couldn\'t help but appreciate how perfectly, uniquely ethereal each one was. Snowdrop\'s legacy had not gone forgotten by the pegasai. \\n\\nAnd as the wind gave him a final love-nip, he grasped his glass mug with trembling paws, overjoyed at the perfection before him. He let out a small tear of joy, silently hoping nopony saw, and gave the cider his first sip. It really was perfect. He sat there, and awaited his friends.\\n\\nOne by one, they came. Pro, anti, or neutral, dozens came by to enjoy a glass of cider with him.\\n[13:40]\\nIt really was the perfect ending to the perfect night."},{"id":"chapter-two-castle","metadata":{"permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-two-castle","editUrl":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT/susFic/tree/main/blog/year23/chapter-two.md","source":"@site/blog/year23/chapter-two.md","title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","description":"Date: 2nd January Year 23","date":"2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"year23","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/year-23"},{"label":"Snek","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/snek"},{"label":"Twilight","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/twilight"},{"label":"Luna","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/luna"},{"label":"Derpy","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/derpy"},{"label":"Celestia","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/celestia"},{"label":"royal-guards","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/royal-guards"},{"label":"shining-armor","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/shining-armor"},{"label":"SFW","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/sfw"},{"label":"POV","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/pov"},{"label":"Capitol","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/capitol"},{"label":"Castle","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/castle"}],"readingTime":2.825,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Snek","title":"Head Of The Problep Council","url":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT","image_url":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif","imageURL":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chapter-two-castle","title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","authors":{"name":"Snek","title":"Head Of The Problep Council","url":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT","image_url":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif","imageURL":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif"},"tags":["year23","Snek","Twilight","Luna","Derpy","Celestia","royal-guards","shining-armor","SFW","POV","Capitol","Castle"],"date":"2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Chapter one: Fox\'s Pumkins","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-fox"},"nextItem":{"title":"Year 23 Chapter One: New Beginnings","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-new-beginnings"}},"content":":::info\\r\\n\\r\\nDate: 2nd January Year 23\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDammit, I cursed to myself; my legs are screaming while the guards chased after me. Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. shorning? No, Shining. That\'s right, Shining, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"YES, I\'M FLYING!\\" I screamed out for the world to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nDammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Shining holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me.

My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!\\" Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony.\\r\\n\\"Ummm, Hi, I\'m Snek,\\" I calmly replied.\\r\\n\\"Sorry about your head; Flash wasn\u2019t meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away,\\" Twilight calmly said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwilight\'s horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Better?\\" the unicorn-Pegasus inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Indeed, thank you,\\" I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, \\"Guards cuff him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, \\"That will not be necessary; Snek won\'t cause any harm to the palace or me.\\" I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, \\"But love-\\". Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence \\"it will be fine.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. \\"Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria.

I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I\'ve got wings now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I\'m small, I\'m a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me."}]}')}}]);
