I was absolutely drained from the long day of work I had yesterday, and it left me powerless when I got home. Of course, coming home to a beautiful royal princess was always the highlight of my day, and it gave me a little high before I inevitably crashed onto the bed and passed out. No matter the day I had, she always has a way of brightening my mood. I truly am the luckiest pony there is on this planet. "),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"My eyes still closed, my mind starts rummaging through its internal storage to take inventory of what todays things to do are. Immediately, I remember the absolute beauty laying right next to me. The thought of this makes my heart flutter quicker than a blink of the eye. My eyes shoot open, looking at the ceiling. That\u2019s not where I want to look, obviously. I gently roll over to my left, being careful to possibly not awaken the royalty laying beside me. As I thought, she\u2019s passed out. Hooves laid out beside her elegantly, her muzzle gently rests tucked into her front hooves. Her mane laying against the pillow with utmost grace, her horn proudly standing tall despite this. I\u2019m now laying on my side, simply admiring her absolute humbling beauty. Looking at her closed eyes, her ears, horn, muzzle, mane, chest, as much as I could see. I slowly pan down to admire the rest of her. Her body, wings, hooves, tail. She had fallen asleep without the covers, I\u2019m guessing she also was pretty tired. It gave me a perfect view of her entire presence. Convenient, if I do say so myself. I look down at myself, hooves and fur clean from the shower last night. I just want to make sure I am physically up to par for this lovely lady. After all, she is royalty.. she only deserves the best. I am a bit sore, my job is quite physical. Nothing I can\u2019t handle, but I sure could use a massage. 5 minutes go by, which seems like an eternity. I could stare at her forever. Impatience starts to get to me. I just want to talk to her. I know I should let her sleep, but its torture for me. I hope she won\u2019t be mad.. "),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"I take a hoof and gently boop her on her snout. \u201cLove.\u201d I say, as soft and gentle as I can. Nothing, she\u2019s out cold. Ugh, I feel so bad. I reach out once more with another boop, this time a little more firm. \u201cLove.\u201d I say again. Her head slowly moves back, she lets out a cute little sigh. \u201cHey, are you awake?\u201d I say with guilt. She puts a hoof over her snout and itches it. Her eyes squint as she tries to wake herself up. I\u2019m simply laying here, admiring every movement. Its something words truly can\u2019t describe. After a little bit of adjusting, her eyes open. My breath is taken away, her beautiful blue eyes level me every single time. She takes a moment to get her mind right, but quickly greets me with a genuine, passionate smile. \u201cGood morning baby girl.\u201d I say with a blush. \u201cGood morning my love,\u201d she replies. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d. She asks happily. I had to think for a second about this, some things we\u2019re still a blur to me. \u201cHonestly, I was out like a light. Work had me so tired yesterday.. how about you?\u201d. She giggles, \u201cI know you we\u2019re, you fell asleep almost immediately.. we only got to talk for 30 minutes before you checked out, I missed you.\u201d My heart almost explodes. \u201cAww, I\u2019m sorry.. I hope you slept well though, I see you also fell asleep suddenly.\u201d I say with a flirty smirk. She smiles brighter. \u201cI sure did, I stayed up a bit studying some ancient artifacts from a book I found.. I\u2019ll have to tell you all about it. After that, I was exhausted. I laid down and I guess that was it.\u201d she chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable, I\u2019d love to hear all about it.\u201d I say with love. She blushes slightly at this. \u201cMaybe, but you\u2019re more adorable..\u201d she teases back. I couldn\u2019t handle it, I bury my head into my hooves and let out a slight squeal of happiness. Yes, while I am a stallion, I get giddy at compliments/affection like that. My love language mainly is words of affirmation. Even despite that, she just makes me feel so small sometimes, and I love it. Seeing me bury my head away, she scoots over closer and puts her front hooves around my head, and pulls me into her soft chest. I sink in like I\u2019m in a cloud and surrender myself. I love her. I love her so much. Emotions of this magnitude simply can\u2019t be put into good enough words. "),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Laying in her chest is one of the best things I could ever imagine. She gently rests her muzzle and head on top of mine. I am hers. She\u2019s the only pony I could ever want. What\u2019s even better is that she\u2019s all mine. How this happened is beyond me, but it seems the stars have aligned.. which, funny that, she control\u2019s those. Did she plan this out? Who knows, what matters is we\u2019re here right now. \u201cLuna.\u201d I say with butterflies flying around my insides. \u201cYes sweetheart?\u201d she replies with a soft, passionate tone. \u201cI, I.. I love you.\u201d The words come out with a stutter due to my immense shyness. Its hard for me to communicate just how I feel sometimes. Luna lets out a real soft and cute squee of emotion. She nuzzles the top of my head with hers and squeezes me with her hooves. \u201cI love you too dear.. you mean the world to me.\u201d I melt further into her soft chest, feeling so warm and cozy.

I gently get on top of her, and surrender. She wraps her hooves around me tightly and squeezes. My heart hurts from all the love I feel, but its so worth it. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d I blurt out. I do, I really do. She giggles cutely, and nuzzles my head with hers. \u201cI love you even more.. you really know how to make a mare happy.\u201d \u201cMeh, I try.

Luna laughs lovingly. \u201cWhenever you want sweetheart.. if you want breakfast now, I\u2019ll make you whatever you wish.\u201d Yep, I\u2019m spoiled. A royal princess willing to make anything for me? I won the lottery. \u201cUmm.. pancakes.. that sounds great to me.\u201d I say. Luna giggles softly. \u201cPancakes it is, cutie pie. Lets go make some.\u201d She rubs me on the head. She\u2019s so comfortable, I don\u2019t want to get off.

I don\u2019t want you being hungry. Besides, we should shower..\u201d she suggests. She\u2019s right, we need to shower. A towel isn\u2019t enough to clean us up especially after what we just did. \u201cFine..\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll get up, I guess..\u201d and so I did. I got up, and gave her a hoof off the bed.
