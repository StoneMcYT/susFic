As my open I yell "With the power of-". Then i realised, I was falling fast really fast. I started to flap my wings to counter balance and increase atmospheric drag, my brain went into hyperdrive trying to calculate my GPE.

I thought to myself, "Alright Twilight you're a smart mare you can do this, so I weigh 45 kilos, and I'm up here, 15 kilometers above sea level. Ignoring atmospheric drag, just gravity. Using the formula of 'Time equals the square root of two times the height divided by the acceleration due to gravity.' So, let's plug in my values without using symbols: Time equals the square root of two times 15,000 divided by 9.81. Alright, after the calculations, it seems like it would take approximately 55.33 seconds for me to hit the ground."

Realisation dawned that I have now less then 40 seconds till i make impact with the solid groound, as I accelerate i flap my wings in an attempt to reduce my speed and at least prevent myself from crashing into the ground. I opened my wings and flapped them as hard as I can, I could see the ground. I flapped one last time and curled into fetal position and ussed my magic to create a circle of protection.

I slowly counted the seconds till I hit the ground, it was coming closer and quicker too and I looked down and realized. "Oh shit its a concret ditch". Then all whent black.

(Coma/Dream)
I woke up slowly suprised to see Discord standing over taunting and gearing at me. 

"Twilight Sparkle, back so soon? Ready for round to? You could'nt even protect your loved wants with that damn power of friendship. You think you can protect yourself?" He Jeered.

Charging up my horn I yelled, "Discord your wrath ends here"

Discord laughed and waves his claw turning me into a latex dummy. All my senses and limbs went numb and I just froze. He turned away and walked into the distance. Slowly I blacked out.

(End of coma)

When I woke up I could see a stallion standing over me, My eyes refocused and I realized there was a stallion on my right with a black coat with white stripes and on my left was a nurse. I caught a name "Nurse Readheart do you think she will be okay?" then the world fell back into darkness. 

After countless nightmares and dreams, I came to my senses again, the drugs must have worn off I try to get up from the bed but I've tripped and fell. Struggling to get up the nurse rushes in to help me up.

"Princess sparkle are you okay?" The white-coated mare asked.
"Fine, just please help me up dear," I replied

Slowly she helped me  back onto the bed and saet me down
