undying curse that would melt each one in his very hands with a mere touch. But this time was different. Freed from his anguish after accepting EE into the neutral blep server, he was finally free. At the front of the grocery store laid a carton what once scourged his very soul. Hesitating to grasp the top one, he asked himself if he was truly free.</p><p>Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst, he squeezed his eyes shut and lunged at its epicarp with an unceremonious jolt. Flinching back out of what had become second nature, he slowly turned back, and stared in amazement as... nothing happened. The pumpkin had not so much as a blemish on it. Finally, after what had felt like a lifetime of rending torment, he was free to enjoy his pumpkins once more.</p><p>And enjoy he would. He spent hours at that grocery store, carefully inspecting each one. He marveled at the sight, enjoying each touch, wondering if it was all a dream. It wasn&#x27;t. At the warning of the store&#x27;s closing, he was ready. He had picked the perfectly ripe, plump, practically neon-orange, pumpkin. Its form shone in the store&#x27;s artificial lighting; a paragon of hope in his formerly bleak world. With the utmost care, he brought it through the store, and drove him, all the why imagining what he would do with it.</p><p>By the time he had come home, it was night. Freshly fallen snow covered the ground, the familiarly cold air biting at him in a way that comforted him, like a loving nip that betrayed any expectations of an unbearable frost. It reminded him of hiking, and as he stared at his pumpkin, he was filled with an overwhelming joy. He knew exactly what he was going to do with this pumpkin.</p><p>Living in Vermon&#x27; doesn&#x27;t leave you without skills. Expertly, he carved a single, circular hole in the pumpkin As its warm, fleshy insides beckoned him, he undid his belt with bated breath and lowered his pants with fervor.
<!-- -->[13:40]<!-- -->
He ran to his bathroom, tired from a a day of work and his time in the grocery store. As much as he loved the snow, nothing felt better than a warm bath. He languished in its warm embrace while his mind raced with thoughts, impatiently anticipating what was to come. He stepped out, toweled off, and dressed himself formally. He was a doctor and he was swag, after all.</p><p>Once again using his Vermon&#x27;ean skills, he carefully scooped out the pulp, and tenderly prepared a picturesque jack-o&#x27;-lantern. Grabbing his best candle, he lovingly lit it, and happily placed it inside his pumpkin. It glowed wonderfully. He stepped back out into the cold Vermon&#x27;ean air, and placed at his porch, ready to greet anypony who happened to pass by.</p><p>He stared at his work with pride, and went back inside. The pulp, what to do with the pulp, he asked himself. As he thought fondly of the day, he could think of nothing better than a warm pumpkin cider. With the grace of a three-star Lunaist chef, he prepared the cider in the traditional bat-pony manner, the perfect drink, to the end the perfect day.</p><p>He donned a warm pegasus-feather scarf, and stepped back out, once more welcomed by the frosty air. He sat down on his porch&#x27;s bench, and admired the scene. The rural Vermon&#x27;ean sky shone with Luna&#x27;s countless stars. His pumpkin had illuminated the scene in a warm, fiery orange that seemed to soothe his very soul. And as fresh snow fell, he couldn&#x27;t help but appreciate how perfectly, uniquely ethereal each one was. Snowdrop&#x27;s legacy had not gone forgotten by the pegasai. </p><p>And as the wind gave him a final love-nip, he grasped his glass mug with trembling paws, overjoyed at the perfection before him. He let out a small tear of joy, silently hoping nopony saw, and gave the cider his first sip. It really was perfect. He sat there, and awaited his friends.</p><p>One by one, they came. Pro, anti, or neutral, dozens came by to enjoy a glass of cider with him.
<!-- -->[13:40]<!-- -->
It really was the perfect ending to the perfect night.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/susFic/blog/tags/sfw">sfw</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/susFic/blog/tags/ee">ee</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/susFic/blog/tags/fox">fox</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/susFic/blog/tags/unrelated-from-mainlore">unrelatedFromMainlore</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/susFic/docs/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/susFic/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/StoneMcYT/susFic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2023 susFic, Inc.
