title: "Chapter one: Fox's Pumkins"
tags: <!-- -->[sfw, ee, fox, unrelatedFromMainlore]</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="date-2023-09-11">date: 2023-09-11<a href="#date-2023-09-11" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to date: 2023-09-11" title="Direct link to date: 2023-09-11">​</a></h2><p>Dr. Swag Fox stared at the voluptuous pumpkins, for years he had been tormented by an undying curse that would melt each one in his very hands with a mere touch. But this time was different. Freed from his anguish after accepting EE into the neutral blep server, he was finally free. At the front of the grocery store laid a carton what once scourged his very soul. Hesitating to grasp the top one, he asked himself if he was truly free.</p><p>Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst, he squeezed his eyes shut and lunged at its epicarp with an unceremonious jolt. Flinching back out of what had become second nature, he slowly turned back, and stared in amazement as... nothing happened. The pumpkin had not so much as a blemish on it. Finally, after what had felt like a lifetime of rending torment, he was free to enjoy his pumpkins once more.</p><p>And enjoy he would. He spent hours at that grocery store, carefully inspecting each one. He marveled at the sight, enjoying each touch, wondering if it was all a dream. It wasn't. At the warning of the store's closing, he was ready. He had picked the perfectly ripe, plump, practically neon-orange, pumpkin. Its form shone in the store's artificial lighting; a paragon of hope in his formerly bleak world. With the utmost care, he brought it through the store, and drove him, all the why imagining what he would do with it.</p><p>By the time he had come home, it was night. Freshly fallen snow covered the ground, the familiarly cold air biting at him in a way that comforted him, like a loving nip that betrayed any expectations of an unbearable frost. It reminded him of hiking, and as he stared at his pumpkin, he was filled with an overwhelming joy. He knew exactly what he was going to do with this pumpkin.</p><p>Living in Vermon' doesn't leave you without skills. Expertly, he carved a single, circular hole in the pumpkin As its warm, fleshy insides beckoned him, he undid his belt with bated breath and lowered his pants with fervor.
<!-- -->[13:40]<!-- -->
He ran to his bathroom, tired from a a day of work and his time in the grocery store. As much as he loved the snow, nothing felt better than a warm bath. He languished in its warm embrace while his mind raced with thoughts, impatiently anticipating what was to come. He stepped out, toweled off, and dressed himself formally. He was a doctor and he was swag, after all.</p><p>Once again using his Vermon'ean skills, he carefully scooped out the pulp, and tenderly prepared a picturesque jack-o'-lantern. Grabbing his best candle, he lovingly lit it, and happily placed it inside his pumpkin. It glowed wonderfully. He stepped back out into the cold Vermon'ean air, and placed at his porch, ready to greet anypony who happened to pass by.</p><p>He stared at his work with pride, and went back inside. The pulp, what to do with the pulp, he asked himself. As he thought fondly of the day, he could think of nothing better than a warm pumpkin cider. With the grace of a three-star Lunaist chef, he prepared the cider in the traditional bat-pony manner, the perfect drink, to the end the perfect day.</p><p>He donned a warm pegasus-feather scarf, and stepped back out, once more welcomed by the frosty air. He sat down on his porch's bench, and admired the scene. The rural Vermon'ean sky shone with Luna's countless stars. His pumpkin had illuminated the scene in a warm, fiery orange that seemed to soothe his very soul. And as fresh snow fell, he couldn't help but appreciate how perfectly, uniquely ethereal each one was. Snowdrop's legacy had not gone forgotten by the pegasai. </p><p>And as the wind gave him a final love-nip, he grasped his glass mug with trembling paws, overjoyed at the perfection before him. He let out a small tear of joy, silently hoping nopony saw, and gave the cider his first sip. It really was perfect. He sat there, and awaited his friends.</p><p>One by one, they came. Pro, anti, or neutral, dozens came by to enjoy a glass of cider with him.
<!-- -->[13:40]<!-- -->
It really was the perfect ending to the perfect night.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. shorning? No, Shining. That's right, Shining, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. </p><p>"YES, I'M FLYING!" I screamed out for the world to see.</p><p>Dammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Shining holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me. The hay, I have done nothing wrong. The orange one knocked me in the head, and all went dark.</p><p><strong> Hours Later: </strong></p><p>I wake up cold, tired, and hungry but comfortable. My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels.</p><p>"Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!" Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony.
"Ummm, Hi, I'm Snek," I calmly replied.
"Sorry about your head; Flash wasn’t meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away," Twilight calmly said.</p><p>Twilight's horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade.</p><p>"Better?" the unicorn-Pegasus inquired.</p><p>"Indeed, thank you," I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh?</p><p>The noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. </p><p>His deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, "Guards cuff him.”</p><p>The guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, "That will not be necessary; Snek won't cause any harm to the palace or me." I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, "But love-". Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence "it will be fine."</p><p>The orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin.</p><p>The white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. "Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria. I'm Celestia; on my left sits Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I've got wings now.</p><p>When I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I'm small, I'm a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.</p><p>I rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me.</p>]]></content:encoded>
